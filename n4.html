    <h3>India needs focus on small farmers for Viksit Bharat: PK Mishra, Principal Secretary to PM</h3>
    <pre>
<strong>While agriculture’s share in India’s economy</strong> has progressively declined to less than 15% due to the high growth rates of the industrial and services sectors, the sector’s importance in India’s economic and social fabric goes well beyond this indicator. 
First, nearly three-quarters of India’s families depend on rural incomes. 
Second, the majority of India’s poor (some 770 million people or about 70 percent) are found in rural areas. 
Third, India’s food security depends on producing cereal crops, as well as increasing its production of fruits, vegetables, and milk to meet the demands of a growing population with rising incomes. To do so, a productive, competitive, diversified, and sustainable agricultural sector will need to emerge at an accelerated pace.

<strong>India is a global agricultural powerhouse.</strong> It is the world’s largest producer of milk, pulses, and spices, and has the world’s largest cattle herd (buffaloes), as well as the largest area under wheat, rice, and cotton. It is the second-largest producer of rice, wheat, cotton, sugarcane, farmed fish, sheep & goat meat, fruit, vegetables, and tea. The country has some 195 m ha under cultivation, of which some 63 percent are rainfed (roughly 125m ha), while 37 percent are irrigated (70m ha). In addition, forests cover some 65m ha of India’s land.

<strong>Challenges:</strong>
1. <strong>Raising agricultural productivity per unit of land:</strong> 
   Raising productivity per unit of land will need to be the main engine of agricultural growth as virtually all cultivable land is farmed. Water resources are also limited, and water for irrigation must contend with increasing industrial and urban needs. All measures to increase productivity will need exploiting, amongst them: increasing yields, diversification to higher-value crops, and developing value chains to reduce marketing costs.

2. <strong>Reducing rural poverty through a socially inclusive strategy</strong> that comprises both agriculture as well as non-farm employment:
   Rural development must also benefit the poor, landless, women, scheduled castes, and tribes. Moreover, there are strong regional disparities: the majority of India’s poor are in rain-fed areas or in the Eastern Indo-Gangetic plains. Reaching such groups has not been easy. While progress has been made—the rural population classified as poor fell from nearly 40% in the early 1990s to below 30% by the mid-2000s (about a 1% fall per year)—there is a clear need for a faster reduction. Hence, poverty alleviation is a central pillar of the rural development efforts of the Government and the World Bank.
