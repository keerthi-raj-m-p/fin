    <h3>What is MuleHunter.AI? RBI's latest tool against financial fraud explained</h3>
    <pre>
<strong>The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI)</strong> dedicated innovation unit, Reserve Bank Innovation Hub (RBIH), is making progress in combating financial fraud by promoting the use of <strong>MuleHunter.AI</strong>, an advanced artificial intelligence tool. This technology specialises in detecting and flagging mule accounts, which are often exploited for money laundering activities.

The tool has been successfully piloted in two public sector banks. According to the <strong>National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB)</strong>, online financial frauds account for 67.8 per cent of cybercrime complaints, highlighting the critical need for effective AI-based fraud prevention solutions.

<strong>What are money mule accounts?</strong>  
As defined by the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub, ‘mule accounts’ are bank accounts used by criminals to funnel illicit funds. These accounts are often created by individuals who are either misled with offers of easy income or coerced into involvement. Their interconnected nature complicates the process of tracking and recovering funds.

<strong>Developing MuleHunter.AI</strong>
The Reserve Bank Innovation Hub collaborated with banks to evaluate existing methods for identifying and reporting mule accounts. Current rule-based detection systems often yield high false-positive rates and slow processing times, leaving many mule accounts undetected.

After analysing 19 distinct patterns of mule account behaviour in partnership with banks, the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub developed <strong>MuleHunter.AI</strong> to address these gaps. Early results indicate significant improvements in detection efficiency and accuracy.
